# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! This repository contains my daily solutions to the programming challenges created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Each day in December leading up to Christmas, a new two-part coding challenge is released. Join me in celebrating the holidays through code! 🎅✨

## 🚀 About

Advent of Code is an annual programming event where each day of December unlocks a fun and challenging puzzle. These puzzles are designed to test problem-solving skills, algorithm design, and creativity. While competitive leaderboards exist, my goal is to learn, improve, and enjoy the journey!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This repository contains solutions implemented in:

- **Go 1.23**  

Feel free to explore the different approaches I've taken and provide feedback or suggestions!

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
advent-of-code-2024/
│
├── day01/                 # Day 1: Challenge and solutions
│   ├── input.txt          # Puzzle input for Day 1
│   ├── solution.go        # Solution code written in Go
│   └── README.md          # Explanation of the approach and thought process
│
├── day02/
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── solution.go
│   └── README.md
│
├── utils/                 # (Optional) Shared helper functions or utilities
│   └── ...
│
├── tests/                 # (Optional) Unit tests for solutions
│   └── ...
│
└── README.md              # This file
```

Each folder (e.g., `day01`, `day02`) contains:

- **`input.txt`**: The provided puzzle input for the day.
- **`solution.go`**: The solution script for the day's challenge.
- **`README.md`**: A brief explanation of my thought process, algorithms, and challenges faced.

## 🧑‍💻 Running the Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the corresponding day's folder and execute the Go program. For example:

```bash
cd day01
go run solution.go
```

Make sure you have [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## 🧪 Testing

(Include this section if you've written unit tests.)

To run the tests, execute:

```bash
go test ./tests/...
```

## 📅 Progress Tracker

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 | Notes |
|-----|--------|--------|-------|
| 1   | ✅      | ✅      |       |
